## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Saunak Roy, and I'm a current undergraduate student at the University of Maryland: College Park studying Computer Science and Mathematics. Here are some of the projects I've worked on or are currently developing:

* Using diffusion models for medical image segmentation and reconstruction
* Brain tumor classification from MRI scans using custom CNN architecture
* Full-stack Health Self-Diagnosing Web Application
* Analyzing US wealth disparities across sociodemographics using data analysis/ML techniques
* Generating n-ary mathematical trees (symmetric, stochastic, etc.) on smooth 2D manifolds
